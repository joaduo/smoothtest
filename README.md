# SmoothTest

[ ![Codeship Status for joaduo/smoothtest](https://codeship.com/projects/cdad4830-b21d-0132-82c3-62decd5a7cb3/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/69981)

General purpose Testing Utilities and also special testing tools for Web Applications

## Better API for accessing Selenium

With smoothtest you can write nicer tests for web sites.

```python
class Home(TestCaseBase):

    _tested_page = '/'

    def test_home(self):
        self.browser.get_page(self._tested_page)
        self.assert_text('//p[@id="msg"]', u'Sign up to request beta access.')
        
    def test_empty_email(self):
        self.browser.get_page(self._tested_page)
        self.browser.click('//a[@class="new_job tab_link"]')
        class_ = self.browser.extract_xpath('//input[@name="email"]/@class')
        self.assertTrue('error' in class_.split(), 'No error style applied')

```

The API is very XPath oriented, so you can test your XPath with Firefox's extensions like FirePath.

## How to use smoothtest

The main utility is the `smoothtest` command. This command monitors your project's files and your unittest files for changes, it will trigger reloading and rerunning tests when a file changes. This means you can work in your code and see how tests are affected automatically. You can select a group of tests files to be monitored - that trigger partial reloads of those same modules -  and an group of files or directories to trigger full reloads of the project.

It also provides a ipython UI interface to modify certain values and re-test.

Do
```
smoothtest
```
To enter the Ipython UI without specifying any initial test.

If you want to start with a specific test, run this to get possible arguments.
```
python -m smoothtest.autotest.Command --help
```

Inside Ipython you you have to commands
```
%smoothtest
%test
%reset
%test_config
%get
%chrome
%firefox
%phantonjs
%steal_xpathbrowser
``` 
Where `%smoothtest` has same parameters as the `smoothtest` command but adds `-u` for updating test parameters and `-f` for forcing a reloading.

`smoothtest` command is still in beta stage, so some functionality won't be as reliable as expected. (but still useful for developing tests) You may need to restart the `smoothtest` command from time to time.

## Configuration

You will need a `smoothtest_settings.py` in your `PYTHONPATH` that looks like this:

``` 
from smoothtest.settings.default import DefaultSettings
import logging

class Settings(DefaultSettings):
    web_server_url = 'http://localhost:8011/'

    webdriver_browser = 'Firefox' #'Chrome' 'PhantomJS'
    ...
``` 

## Installing
You can use pip to install it:
```
pip install smoothtest 
``` 
Or uninstall it:
```
pip uninstall smoothtest 
``` 

## Windows and Mac OSX

I tested Smoothtest under Linux, although it was designed to be multiplatform I still haven't fully tested outside Linux.
